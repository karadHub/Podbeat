## How it works

Podbeat runs in two modes depending on your setup:

### Demo mode (no API needed)

Without API credentials:

- Curated collection of 2024-2025 chart toppers with verified Spotify metadata
- Works immediately after `git clone` and `npm install`
- Real album artwork and track metadata from Spotify CDN
- Features artists like Billie Eilish, Harry Styles, Morgan Wallen, Taylor Swift, and more
- Enhanced search functionality with mock data

Benefits:

- Perfect for trying out the app quickly
- No API setup required
- Images load from Spotify CDN
- Shows off the full UI and search capabilities

<br/>

### With Spotify API (recommended)

If you have Spotify API credentials:

- Real-time access to Spotify's music catalog
- Search across millions of tracks, albums, and artists
- Latest trending songs and new releases
- All features available with live data

Requires:

- Spotify API credentials in `.env` file
- Backend server running for CORS handling

<br/>
Podbeat automatically detects which mode to use and provides seamless fallback.

## Getting started

You need Node.js 18+ and npm.

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/karadHub/podbeat.git
cd podbeat
npm install

# Start the app
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` - Podbeat works immediately with demo data and full functionality.

### üéØ Quick Start Features

- **Search**: Use the search bar or press `Cmd+K`/`Ctrl+K` to open the command palette
- **Browse**: Explore the Latest Hits section with curated 2024-2025 tracks
- **Play**: Click any track to start the mini player with audio previews
- **Navigate**: Use the sidebar and header navigation for seamless browsing

<br>

### Want live Spotify data?

1. Create a [Spotify Developer Account](https://developer.spotify.com/) and create a new app
2. Get your Client ID and Client Secret from the app dashboard
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```
4. Add your credentials to `.env`:
   ```env
   VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   VITE_USE_BACKEND_PROXY=true
   ```
5. Start with the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:full
   ```

This will start both the backend server (port 3001) and frontend (port 5173) simultaneously.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**CORS Errors with Spotify API**

- **Problem:** API requests fail due to CORS restrictions
- **Solution:** Ensure the backend server is running (`npm run dev:full` or `npm run server:dev`)
- **Details:** Spotify Web API cannot be called directly from browsers due to CORS policy

**Missing Environment Variables**

- **Problem:** Podbeat shows "No music data available" or API errors
- **Solution:** Check that `.env` file exists with valid Spotify credentials
- **Note:** Podbeat works perfectly in demo mode without API credentials

**Port Conflicts**

- **Frontend (Port 5173):** Check if another Vite/dev server is running
- **Backend (Port 3001):** Check if another Express server is using the port
- **Solution:** Kill existing processes or modify port configuration

**Audio Playback Issues**

- **Problem:** Tracks don't play or show "No preview available"
- **Solution:** This is normal - not all tracks have preview URLs. Podbeat will show a simulation for tracks without previews
- **Details:** Preview availability depends on Spotify's licensing agreements

**Build/TypeScript Errors**

- **Problem:** TypeScript compilation errors during build
- **Solution:** Run `npm run build` to see specific error details
- **Common fix:** Ensure all dependencies are installed (`npm install`)

**Search Not Working**

- **Problem:** Command palette or search returns no results
- **Solution:** Try different search terms, check if you're in demo mode (which has limited but high-quality data)
- **Details:** Demo mode includes 20+ verified tracks from 2024-2025 charts

<br/>
